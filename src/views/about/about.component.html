          <p>
               Hey there! I'm a full stack web developer with a passion for writing the best single page applications
               using the latest technologies and frameworks. I'm also a psychology graduate, an AI enthusiast, and a
               Photoshop wizard! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
          </p>
          <p>
               My journey in coding started with a 640-hour intensive bootcamp at the Coding Academy, and it's been a
               non-stop rollercoaster of learning and growing since then.
